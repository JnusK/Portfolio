    md: `# Winter trip to Slovenia

As part of my graduation trip, I brought my parents along on a long trip in Europe. 
One of the countries that we visited is Slovenia.
As with many people, this small country in Europe entered my radar after Lake Bled became famous on Instagram.
My goals in Slovenia was to visit Lake Bled and to ski in the Julian Alps.

## Lake Bled
> Most interesting lake in Slovenia

Winter is a beautiful time to visit Bled. During my 2 days there, we met less than 20 people while walking around the lake. 
Furthermore, the short but steep hike up to the view point at the west of the lake will be cooling. 
In winter, the only boats on the lake are the electric ones, with the other boats all moored up on the shore. 

The only downside is Vintgar Gorge being closed during winter.

## Lake Bohinj
> Quiet and relaxing

Lake Bohinj is the bigger neighbor to Lake Bled but with much less limelight. It is surrounded by a couple of villages and is more alive in summer than winter.
There are a few hiking trails around the lake and a ski center.
I wanted to stay here due to the [Vogel Ski Center](http://www.vogel.si/) nearby. Unfortunately, I was too early and the lack of snow meant that only the kiddie slope was open.
After half a day of hiking around the tranquil lake and meeitng less than a handful of people, I quickly became bored of Lake Bohinj and had to find some other attractions.

## Waterfall Pericnik
> Wonderful gem in winter

Due to the lack of activities in Lake Bohinj, I took a spontaneous trip with a rental car to Triglav National Park (since I am already in it).
The mini road trip brought us to one of the most beautiful spot in Slovenia. 

During winter, the road was covered in snow and all facilities near the waterfall was closed. 
There is free parking (in winter) along the road at the trail head and after a short 15 minute hike up a trail, we saw the waterfall.
The waterfall was partially frozen, with the sides full of icicles while the roar of the water continues unabated.

PS: The trail is slippery near the waterfall and crampons are recommended as there are no handholds at some places.

## Ljubljana
> A compact capital friendly to pedestrians.

Ljubljana was the last minute replacement as I cut my time short at Lake Bohinj due to the lack of snow. 
We found an airbnb near the train station, which is walkable to the old town where all the tourist attractions are. 
The old town i so compact that 1 full day allowed us to explore most of the attractions there. 
We started off the day walking around the Central Market, which is a farmer's market selling fresh food and groceries. 
That was not the best idea as I had to lug a jar of honey with me for the rest of the day.

I would recommend Ljubljana Castle, the castle that is situated at the top of a hill overlooking the old town. 
It offers not only views of the entire city but also a small but interesting museum complex. 
After all the walking, we ate ice cream at Cacao which offers outdoor seats with gas heating. 
The chocolate ice cream was great!`
