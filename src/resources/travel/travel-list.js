      'Due to the lack of activities in Lake Bohinj, I took a spontaneous trip with a rental car to Triglav National Park (since I am already in it).\n' +
      'The mini road trip brought us to one of the most beautiful spot in Slovenia. \n' +
      '\n' +
      'During winter, the road was covered in snow and all facilities near the waterfall was closed. \n' +
      'There is free parking (in winter) along the road at the trail head and after a short 15 minute hike up a trail, we saw the waterfall.\n' +
      'The waterfall was partially frozen, with the sides full of icicles while the roar of the water continues unabated. \n' +
